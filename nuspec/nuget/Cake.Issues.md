## How to use

Integrating Cake.Issues into your Cake build is straightforward.
With minimal setup, teams can enjoy the benefits of enhanced code quality management seamlessly integrated into their existing build pipeline.

### Reading issues

The addin provides the `ReadIssues` alias to read issues.
It needs an additional NuGet packages to provide the specific issue provider implementation.

See [Issue Providers] for a list of available issue providers.

### Creating issues

To create issues directly in the build script the `NewIssue` alias can be used:

```csharp
[TaskName("Create-Issue")]
public sealed class CreateIssueTask : FrostingTask<BuildContext>
{
    public override void Run(BuildContext context)
    {
        var issue =
            context
                .NewIssue(
                    "Something went wrong",
                    "MyCakeScript",
                    "My Cake Script")
                .WithMessageInHtmlFormat("Something went <b>wrong</b>")
                .WithMessageInMarkdownFormat("Something went **wrong**")
                .InFile("myfile.txt", 42)
                .WithPriority(IssuePriority.Warning)
                .Create();

        context.Information("Issue created with message: {0}", issues.MessageText);
    }
}
```

### Creating reports

Issue reports can be created using any of the available [Report Format] addin.

### Reporting issues to pull requests and build systems

Issues can be written as comments to pull requests or reported to build systems using any of the
available [Pull Request System] addin.
