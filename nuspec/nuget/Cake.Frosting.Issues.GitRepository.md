## How to use

Integrating Cake.Issues into your Cake build is straightforward.
With minimal setup, teams can enjoy the benefits of enhanced code quality management seamlessly integrated into their existing build pipeline.

After adding the addin the repository can be analyzed:

```csharp
[TaskName("Analyze-GitRepository")]
public sealed class AnalyzeGitRepositoryTask : FrostingTask<BuildContext>
{
    public override void Run(BuildContext context)
    {
        var repoRootPath = @"c:\repo";

        // Analyze repository.
        var issues =
            context.ReadIssues(
                context.GitRepositoryIssues(
                    new GitRepositoryIssuesSettings
                    {
                        CheckBinaryFilesTrackedByLfs = true
                    }
                ),
                repoRootPath);

        context.Information("{0} issues are found.", issues.Count());
    }
}
```
