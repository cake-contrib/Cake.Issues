The DocFx support for the Cake.Issues addin for Cake allows you to read warnings from DocFx log files.

Cake.Issues redefines issue management within the Cake build system by offering a comprehensive, universal, and extensible solution.
The unique capabilities of the addins empower development teams to enforce coding standards, generate insightful reports,
seamlessly incorporate various linting tools, and streamlining the integration with pull requests.
With its [modular architecture] and extensive [set of aliases], Cake.Issues provides a future-proof infrastructure for issue management
in Cake builds, fostering a more efficient and adaptable development process.

## How to use

Integrating Cake.Issues into your Cake build is straightforward.
With minimal setup, teams can enjoy the benefits of enhanced code quality management seamlessly integrated into their existing build pipeline.

After adding the addin the log file of a DocFx build can be parsed:

```csharp
[TaskName("Build-Documentation")]
public sealed class BuildDocumentationTask : FrostingTask<BuildContext>
{
    public override void Run(BuildContext context)
    {
        var logPath = @"c:\build\docfx.log";
        var repoRootPath = @"c:\repo";
        var docRootPath = @"docs";

        // Run DocFx using Cake.DocFx addin.
        context.DocFxBuild(new DocFxBuildSettings()
        {
            LogPath = logPath
        });

        // Read issues.
        var issues =
            context.ReadIssues(
                context.DocFxIssuesFromFilePath(logPath, docRootPath),
                repoRootPath);

        context.Information("{0} issues are found.", issues.Count());
    }
}
```
