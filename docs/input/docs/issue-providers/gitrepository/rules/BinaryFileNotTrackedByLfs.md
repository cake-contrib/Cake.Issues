## Cause

A binary file in the repository is not tracked by [Git Large File System].

## Rule description

By its nature Git repositories cannot handle binary files well and will keep a full copy of that file in the repository every time a change to that file is committed.
Considering that you always clone the full history of a repository, and not only the latest version, using binary files in a repository considerably slow downs the operation.
[Git Large File System] replaces large files with small text pointers inside the Git repository, while storing the file contents on a remote server.

:::{.alert .alert-info}
The rule assumes that all files, which are not text files are binary files.
This also includes for example empty files.
