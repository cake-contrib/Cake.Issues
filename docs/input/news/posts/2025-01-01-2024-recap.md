## Alignment of addin lifecycles

2024 started with an [announcement to consolidate all Cake Issue addins] into the main [Cake.Issues GitHub repository],
which has been finished by now.

Beside having all addins share a release lifecycle, having them in a single repository also simplified maintenance work and release process.
This resulted in a total of 20 releases of Cake Issues in 2024, including one major release with [5.0.0], bringing constant improvements and bugfixes.

Core `Cake.Issues` addin has seen a steady, and stronger than 2023, rise of downloads during 2024,
resulting in nearly 1 million downloads by the end of the year:

See [NuGet Trends](https://nugettrends.com/packages?ids=Cake.Issues&months=12) for details.

The individual addins had a different age, some up to [7 years old], written for .NET Framework.
As part of the consolidation of all addins in a single mono-repository effort was made to unify and modernize the code base across all addins.

## New addins

With the [introduction of Cake.Issues.Sarif] a lot of additional tools supporting the [SARIF] standard
are now supported by Cake Issues as listed on [Supported Tools].

## Improvements for Cake Frosting

Several improvements were released during 2024 for running Cake Issues with Cake Frosting.

For all addins a NuGet package optimized for running with Cake Frosting is now available.
These NuGet packages have dependencies to Cake, Cake Issues core addins or any other required dependency defined,
which gives full control about the dependency, their version and update behavior to the user through the standard .NET project system.

These packages also support implicit usings improving discoverability of aliases for build authors.
Implicit usings can be enabled by setting `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>` in the csproj file of a build.

## Updated website

The end of 2024 saw also the [relaunch of Cake Issues website], which has been updated to modern standards and tooling.
Effort has also been put into content to improve discoverability of documentation for users.
Examples and documentation have also been updated to latest Cake Issues and .NET version.
