1.  Please note that you always should pin addins to a specific version to make sure your builds are deterministic and
    won't break due to updates to one of the addins.

    See [pinning addin versions](https://cakebuild.net/docs/writing-builds/reproducible-builds/){target="_blank"} for details.
